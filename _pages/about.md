My name is Jiaxiang Liu, you can call me Jerry!

I am a third-year Ph.D. student supervised by Prof. [Eugene Wu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ewu/) at Columbia Univeristy. I am interested in database, machine learning and causal inference. I am currently working on task-based data search systems for data-centric tasks such as machine learning and causal inference.

Prior to Columbia, I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science/Statistics/Combinatiory & Optimization in Univeristy of Waterloo. At Waterloo, I worked on Differential Privacy and its database applications with Prof. [Xi He](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~xihe/)
